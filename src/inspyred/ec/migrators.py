    :mod:`migrators` -- Solution migration methods
    ==============================================
    
    This module provides pre-defined migrators for evolutionary computations.

    All migrator functions have the following arguments:
    
    - *random* -- the random number generator object
    - *population* -- the population of Individuals
    - *args* -- a dictionary of keyword arguments
    
    Each migrator function returns the updated population.
    
    Migrator functions would typically be used for multi-population approaches,
    such as island-model evolutionary computations. They provide a means for
    individuals to be transferred from one population to another during the
    evolutionary process.

    """Migrate among processes on the same machine.
    
    This callable class allows individuals to migrate from one process 
    to another on the same machine. It maintains a queue of migrants
    whose maximum length can be fixed via the ``max_migrants``
    parameter in the constructor. If the number of migrants in the queue
    reaches this value, new migrants are not added until earlier ones
    are consumed. The unreliability of a multiprocessing environment
    makes it difficult to provide guarantees. However, migrants are 
    theoretically added and consumed at the same rate, so this value
    should determine the "freshness" of individuals, where smaller
    queue sizes provide more recency.
    
    An optional keyword argument in ``args`` requires the migrant to be
    evaluated by the current evolutionary computation before being inserted 
    into the population. This can be important when different populations 
    use different evaluation functions and you need to be able to compare 
    "apples with apples," so to speak.
    
    The migration takes the current individual *I* out of the queue, if
    one exists. It then randomly chooses an individual *E* from the population
    to insert into the queue. Finally, if *I* exists, it replaces *E* in the
    population (re-evaluating fitness if necessary). Otherwise, *E* remains in 
    the population and also exists in the queue as a migrant.
    
    Optional keyword arguments in args:
    
    - *evaluate_migrant* -- should new migrants be evaluated before 
      adding them to the population (default False)
