    :mod:`selectors` -- Parent selection methods
    ============================================
    
    This module provides pre-defined selectors for evolutionary computations.

    All selector functions have the following arguments:
    
    - *random* -- the random number generator object
    - *population* -- the population of individuals
    - *args* -- a dictionary of keyword arguments
    
    Each selector function returns the list of selected individuals.

    .. note::
    
       The *population* is really a shallow copy of the actual population of
       the evolutionary computation. This means that any activities like
       sorting will not affect the actual population.
