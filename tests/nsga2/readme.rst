DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
====================

Clusters were chosen out of
/share/lcbcsrv5/lcbcdata/duerr/md/GB1_AZIACN_restrained_eq3/analysis/ligand_clustering/ZN_azi_distance/100clusters

The clusters were made using sieve10 and clustering based on Zn-Azi distance on 100ns NPT trajectory

I picked clusters 1 2 6 9 14 17  22 61 66 91
